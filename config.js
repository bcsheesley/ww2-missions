I took over the ship againâ€”the bombays were openâ€”target just aheadâ€”we had to get back in! If fighters hit we would have been sunk.</p><p>All our hearts were poundingâ€”nerves at the break point-sweat rolling at 40Â° below. I quickly turned on the emergency turbo and the engines were giving all they hadâ€”they shook and shuddered and whined as if to say "we can\'t take this long."

            description: '<span class="dropQuote">&ldquo;</span><p><span class="dropCap">B</span> riefing this morning was at 04:00. Our target for today was a marshalling yard at <s>Castle</s> Kassel, Germany. We took off and hit a low ceiling and climbed in solid overcast up to 11,000 ft. Our position was 4â€“3 in High squadron. Overcast 10/10 over targetâ€”results not observed. Flack was dense and we got our first hits. Our gas tank in right wing had to be replaced upon return. Oxygen system was leaking and was empty as we reached 10,000\' on descendingâ€”sweating it out. Visibility very poor upon returnâ€”we made 6 passes at field before getting in. Went to bed at 20:00 hours.</p>',
